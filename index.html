<td style="width: 100%;">AutoMID is a systematic, hierarchical schema of key metadata features of small molecules, in a comprehensive framework to better ensure the application of all FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to manage scientific data. This project focuses on addressing a critical issue of chemical ambiguity that arises when a single, non-systematic chemical identifier is linked to multiple systematic identifiers. In addition, the most widely used systematic representations have deficiencies, such as clear differentiation of an enantiomeric mixture, or an unknown configuration, or relative vs absolute configuration of two or more stereocenters. Chemical structure ambiguity is not just a legacy problem in the context of historical data, but it remains a pervasive issue were errors propagate through public data sources while, in addition, new errors are introduced.</td>
